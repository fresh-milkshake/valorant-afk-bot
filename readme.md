A primitive utility for sending key presses to the VALORANT game to prevent the player from being identified as AFK. Under the hood, it uses the pywin32 library and PyQt6.

Theoretically, you can now get banned for this, but if you don't abuse it, it's unlikely. Nevertheless, the user bears responsibility for the possible consequences of using this software.

## How to use

1. Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/fresh-milkshake/valorant-afk-bot/releases)
2. Run the program and VALORANT itself (the order doesn't matter here)
3. Start the game and when you need to step away, just click the `Start` button
